# Storage

Refers to ability to put your data in the cloud. There are different tools for accessing that data.

## Storage types

1) **File based storage** Files have names and organized in directories and subdirectories.  
   Pros/Cons:
    * Easy to store
    * With large amount of files it becomes difficult to find and organize them

2) **Block storage** Files are split into chunks of data of equal size, and they are stored in raw storage volumes.  
   Typically used by server-based operating systems, which manages those volumes and use them as individual hard drives.
   **Commonly used in databases, email servers**, and **is ideal for RAID** systems where blocks are stored over
   multiple disk, which
   present as a single volume to operating systems.  
   Virtual machines also tend to block storage as file systems for the operating systems inside their virtual machines.

*Note*:  
**[RAID](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/RAID)** - Redundant Array of Independent Disks.  
Is a way of storing the same data in different places on multiple hard
disks or solid-state drives (SSDs) to protect data in the case of a drive failure. There are different RAID levels,
however, and not all have the goal of providing redundancy.

3) **Object storage**. Useful in cloud based storage. **(S3)**   
   Files are stored as objects. Each object has unique identifier and is stored in a flat memory model.  
   This allows to get object by hash, and it still works if the file is not in the local server.

## Services to manage storage

### File storage

* Elastic File System (EFS) - A scalable, elastic and cloud native Network File System
* FSx for Windows File Server - A fully managed file storage for Windows Server
* Elastic Block Storage (EBS) - Easy to use, high performance block storage. **This is what EC2 uses to store all its
  files**.

### Object storage

* Simple Storage Service (**S3**) - Store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere in the world

### Backup

* Backup - centrally manage and automate backups across AWS services

### Data transfer

* Storage Gateway - provide on-premises access to unlimited cloud storage
* DataSync - Easily transfer data to and from AWS up to 10 times faster than normal
* Transfer Family - Transfer files to Amazon S3 using SFPT, FTP, and FTPS

## S3 and S3 Glacier

### Amazon S3

*Object storage service* (that is region dependent)

There are different types of storages:

* **S3 Standard storage class**
* **S3 Standard-Infrequent** (for data you want to store but not access frequently)
* **S3 One Zone-Infrequent** (for data you want to store but not access frequently)
* **S3 Glacier** (Cold storage solution. Aimed at long term archival)
* **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** (Cold storage solution. Aimed at long term archival)
* **S3 Intelligent Tiering** - will try to automatically save you money by moving object between 4 different access tiers
  when your usage patterns change. **When you have unknown access patterns of your data**

**Bucket Versioning** - allows to store multiple versions of the same object to add additional layer of protection

### S3 Glacier

*Extremely cheep options for data you don't need to access quickly* (12-48 hours to get your files)

* Data archival and long term backups
* Deep Archive 1$ per TB per month
* Query-in-place functionality (run analytics on your archived data where it's stored)
* Three data retrieval options:
    * Standard retrieval - low cost within few hours (good for getting back-ups)
    * Bulk retrieval - cost-effective retrieval for large amounts of data for non-urgent use-cases
    * Expedited retrieval - urgent retrieval

## Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)

*Fully managed service, which provides NFS shared filesystem for Linux virtual machines in EC2*  
***Network File System** (NFS) - a protocol that allows to access files and directories that are not your system, but
are
connected to your network

**Is needed when large amounts of data needs to be processed with their EC2. As it is difficult to analyze data
stored in S3, so sometimes data has to be stored on the machines doing the actual analysis, and that's where EFS
shines**.

* Multiple servers can access EFS filesystem at the same time
* All files are automatically stored across multiple availability zones in a region to prevent any data loss.
* Built-in provtection from Availability Zone (AZ) outage and other failures

Two different storage classes:

* Standard
* Infrequent Access
    * Aging policy can be set up to automatically move files to the infrequent access storage class after 7,14,,30,60 or
      90 days. Can save a lot of money if you know that you don't have to store all of your files all the time.
* Automatically grows and shirks as you add or remove files. (This takes away a need of disk managment that you
  typically have with hard disks attached to virtual machines)
* Encryption enabled by default when you create EFS files system. Encrypt the files that are stored in your volumes.

## AWS Storage Gateway

*Service that gives you access to virtually unlimited cloud storage, but on-premises* (so at your office of data center)

Also includes: bandwidth management and automatic network resilience.  
**It is actually 3 different storage gateways**:

### 1. File gateway

*Gives you SMB and NFS interfaces to Amazon S3  
Takes care of putting files in cloud for you even if an application was only programmed to store files locally*

This means that in both Windows and Linux you will have a filesystem, which looks like a normal network drive attached
to your system. And when your system writes files to this system - it will be stored in S3.  
(Which then can be used with any other AWS service which interfaces with S3. E.g. for machine learning, analytics,
lambda)

### 2. Tape gateway

*Presents a virtual tape library on your local network  
Useful for companies who are still backing up their files to tape, but want to move to the cloud*

* Compatible with all major backup software (Commvault,Veeam,Veritas)
* Tape contents are stored in S3 and you can add S3 Glacier for long time archival.

### 3. Volume gateway

*Service that presents iSCSI block storage volume to your on-premises applications*

It stores and manages on-premises data in S3 on your behalf and operates in either *stored mode* or *cached mode*.

**In cached mode** your primary data is stored in S3 and the most frequently accessed is stored locally for low latency
access.

**In the stored mode** all of the data is stored locally while also being backed up to S3 asynchronously.
