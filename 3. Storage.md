# Storage

Refers to ability to put your data in the cloud. There are different tools for accessing that data.

## Storage types

1) **File based storage** Files have names and organized in directories and subdirectories.  
   Pros/Cons:
    * Easy to store
    * With large amount of files it becomes difficult to find and organize them

2) **Block storage** Files are split into chunks of data of equal size, and they are stored in raw storage volumes.  
   Typically used by server-based operating systems, which manages those volumes and use them as individual hard drives.
   **Commonly used in databases, email servers**, and **is ideal for RAID** systems where blocks are stored over
   multiple disk, which
   present as a single volume to operating systems.  
   Virtual machines also tend to block storage as file systems for the operating systems inside their virtual machines.

*Note*:  
**[RAID](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/RAID)** - Redundant Array of Independent Disks.  
Is a way of storing the same data in different places on multiple hard
disks or solid-state drives (SSDs) to protect data in the case of a drive failure. There are different RAID levels,
however, and not all have the goal of providing redundancy.

3) **Object storage**. Useful in cloud based storage.  
   Files are stored as objects. Each object has unique identifier and is stored in a flat memory model.  
   This allows to get object by hash, and it still works if the file is not in the local server.

## Services to manage storage

### File storage

* Elastic File System (EFS) - A scalable, elastic and cloud native network file system
* FSx for Windows File Server - A fully managed file storage for Windows Server
* Elastic Block Storage (EBS) - Easy to use, high performance block storage. **This is what EC2 uses to store all its
  files**.

### Object storage

* Simple Storage Service (**S3**) - Store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere in the world

### Backup

* Backup - centrally manage and automate backups across AWS services

### Data transfer

* Storage Gateway - provide on-premises access to unlimited cloud storage
* DataSync - Easily transfer data to and from AWS up to 10 times faster than normal
* Transfer Family - Transfer files to Amazon S3 using SFPT, FTP, and FTPS
