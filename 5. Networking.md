# Networking

### Cloud Network

* VPC - Define and provision an isolated network for your AWS resources
* Transit Gateway - Connect VPCs and on-premise networks
* Private Link - provide private connectivity between VPCs and on-premise applications
* Route 53 - Host your own, managed DNS (Domain Name System)

### Network Scaling

* Elastic Load Balancing - Automatically distribute network traffic across a pool of resources
* Global Accelerator - Direct traffic through the AWS global network to improve global application performance

### Content Delivery

* CloudFront - Securely deliver data, videos and applications to customers globally with low latency and high transfer
  speeds

## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Network Interface - bridge between computer and technology used to connect to the other computer.  
In global network we usually use IPv4 (four sets of number ranging from 0 to 255) e.g. x.x.x.x

There are IP addresses agreed to be used only for private networks. They start with:

* 10\. ...
* from 172.16. ... to 172.31. ...
* 192.168. ...

**Amazon VPC lets you create a virtual network for your AWS services to exist in local IP range** using that local
network.
VPC is your own little gated community for your virtual machines and other services. If you have multiple servers in the
same VPC - they can talk to each other.

* To allow you virtual machines to access the internet you can add **NAT gateway**.
* To allow Internet to access your EC2 instances you can add **Internet gateway**
* **Network Access Control List (ACL)** - sets which traffic is allowed into and out of your VPC network

## Cloud Front

*Content delivery network*

Edge locations - location around the world where you can serve your website with cloud front.

* Increases security (saves your server from server denial attacks)
* Traffic spike protection
* Lambda@Edge (run Lambda code at these edge locations)
* Real-time metrics and logging

## Route 53

*DNS service*

When you visit a site you request a resources from server. This server has some IP address.  
**DNS** (Domain Name System) - is **a database of mapping of domain names and IP addresses**.

### Simple Routing Policy

When request is coming, with simple routing policy, Route 53 would reply with the IP address of your server.

### Weighted Policy

You can provide multiple IP addresses to spread you internet traffic load. Weigh determines how much priority a
particular IP address gets. Weigh is a number between 0 and 255. If you give 3 IP addresses 100 each - traffic will be
evenly spead among them.

*Great way to test a new version of a website with a small subset of the users, and you can even use it to slowly
transition all you users to a new website*

### Geolocation Policy

*Reply with a certain IP address for user's in different parts of the world*

### Latency Policy

*Reply with the IP address of AWS resources which have the lowest latency or fastest response time to the user*

### Fail-over Policy

*Point traffic to a single IP address, but if for some reason that server goes offline, Route 53 will point your website
somewhere else*

### Multivalue Answer Policy

*Reply with multiple healthy values for the domain that gets queried*

This policy is not a substitute for a load balancer, but it can help with improving availability and load balancing.
