# Databases

Database types (AWS has more that more than 15):

* Relational
* Key-value
* In-memory
* Document
* Graph
* Time series
* Wide column
* Ledger

### Relational DBs

* Aurora - MySQL and PostgreSQL compatible database built for the could
* Relational database service (RDS) - Easily set up, use and scale muplitpe DB engines
* Redshift - A cloud data warehouse. Has 6 DB engines for different purposes

### Key Value DBs

* DynamoDB - Fast and flexible NoSQL database for any scale

### In-memory DBs

* ElastiCache - Managed, in-memory data store service for Redis, and Memcached. Used for caching, session management,
  gaming leaderboards.

### Document DB

* DocumentDB - MongoDB compatible, fast, scalable highly available document database. Used for content managmenet,
  catalogs and user profiles

## Relational Database Service (RDS)

*Create, run and scale relational databases*

Has 6 BD engines:

* MySQL
* MariaDB
* Microsoft SQL Server
* PostgreSQL
* Oracle
* **Amazon Aurora**

Pros:

* Scalable
* Can be used across different availability zones
* Some DBs allow to create read-only replicas. (Increase read throughput for read-heavy workloads)
* Backups are automated
* You can take a snapshot of DB and create another DB from snapshot
* Automatic host replacements
* Cost-effective

## DynamoDB

*Key-Value document DB which delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale*

Note: NoSQL (apparently) means that

* data is retrieved differently that in a relational DB
* But also can refer to Not Only SQL (as some NoSQL DBs support SQL-like queries)

DynamoDB:

* Fully managed
* Works in multiple regions
* Built-in security, backup and restore
* Can handle 10 trillion requests per day (now handles 1 trillion requests per day)
* Can handle peaks of 20 million requests per second
* Works well with serverless applications (store and process data without any servers)
* Works well for storing mobile application data as it is fast enough to store real time updates

## ElastiCache

*In-memory data store*

(You access it first before you go to database)
Pros:

* If configured correctly - can respond with sub millisecond latency
* Has 2 engines: Redis, Memcached
* Can be scaled on demand
