# Compute

Available services in this pillar:

### Instances:

* EC2 - Secure and resizable virtual machines in the cloud
* EC2 Spot - Run fault-tolerant workloads at 90% of the normal price
* EC2 Auto Scaling - Automatically add or remove capacity based on demand
* Lightsail - An easy-to-use cloud platform to build applications or websites

### Containers:

* ECS (Elastic Container Service) - Run secure, reliable and scalable containers
* ECR (Elastic Container Registry) - Store, manage and deploy container images
* EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) - Fully managed Kubernetes service

### Serverless

*Service that lets you run code without a server*

* Lambda - A compute service to run code without servers

### Edge services

* AWS Outpost - Run AWS services on-premises
* AWS Snow Family - Allows to bring a lot of your data into AWS. (Order devices in which you put files, and then they
  are
* shipped to AWS to load your data into your AWS account)
* AWS Wavelength - Access AWS services via 5G networks
* VMWare Cloud on AWS - Migrate your VMWare workloads into AWS
* AWS Local Zones - Run latency sensitive applications close to end user

## EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

Allows you to:

* Rent virtual computers (EC2 instances)
* Choose from various EC2 types of preconfigured options (different amount of CPU, RAM and storage)
* Different optimizations available (compute optimized, RAM optimized, storage optimized for workloads that need to read
  and write to hard-disk a lot)
* Pay by the hour/second when is used
* Easy vertical scaling available if needed (switching to another machine type)

## Containers (Elastic Container Service)

Creates a package of your program, all of its libraries and dependencies and produces an image that can be run on any
computer.
Once container created - can be deployed anywhere.

*With Amazon Elastic Container Service you can deploy your images to AWS.*

## Lambda

*Kicked off the serverless computing craze :)*

Serverless computing - means you dont need to have a server to run your piece of code.

Lambda:

* Serverless computing service
* Runs your code in response to events (could be a timer, or someone visits a certain part of your website, or they
  upload an image to it, etc)
* Runs your code "somewhere" and you cannot choose the hardware on which it would run
* Charged by the millisecond
* Price depends on how much RAM you choose to use
